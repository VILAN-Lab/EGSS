 these `` classical '' concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world .
 a continuum of overlapping events
 a `` society '' of events
 `` classical '' concepts
 change
 quality '' , `` matter '' , and `` form ''
 society
 continuum of overlapping events
 discrete `` occasions of experience '' that overlap one another in time and space , and jointly make up the enduring person or thing
 `` defining essence '' or a `` core identity ''

 people define identities
 should not prevent people from realizing that `` material substances '' or `` essences '' are a convenient generalized description of a continuum

 limitations of language
 each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things
 the idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space , and not necessarily related to anything
 in whitehead 's view , relations take a primary role , perhaps even more important than the relata themselves
 it sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects .
 it obscures the importance of relations
 materialism
 distinct and discrete
 externally
 in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities -- its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it
 relations are not secondary to what a thing is , they are what the thing is .
 nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities
 they are what the thing is

 consciousness
 the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities
 an entity is not merely a sum of its relations , but also a valuation of them and reaction to them

 prehension

 conscious or unconscious

 a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons
 entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them

 presentational immediacy
 `` the experience dominating the primitive living organisms , which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged , and the fate towards which they go . ''
 `` pure sense perception '' , unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation , even unconscious interpretation
 symbolic reference
 causation
 links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it
 an ordinary person looks up , sees a colored shape , and immediately infers that it is a chair
 `` might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape . ''
 `` would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such . ''
 `` life is comparatively deficient in survival value . ''

 `` the brief galilean vision of humility ''
 `` the church gave unto god the attributes which belonged exclusively to caesar . ''
 primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world , and whose most important attribute is power
 god is not necessarily tied to religion
 primordial nature of god
 the consequent nature
 dipolar
 his system required that an order exist among possibilities , an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities .
 god 's reception of the world 's activity
 god saves and cherishes all experiences forever
 it is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved .
 those experiences go on to change the way god interacts with the world
 god is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe , lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance .
 deficient in actuality and change
 merely eternally unrealized possibilities
 whitehead thus sees god and the world as fulfilling one another
 he sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only god can provide
 by taking them into god 's self , thereafter changing god and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time
 individual
 `` religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary , you are never religious . ''
 a system of general truths that transformed a person 's character
 while religion is often a good influence , it is not necessarily good
 solitariness
 `` the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals . ''
 meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone , but only in the context of the universal community
 the spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself
 the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent

 god 's relational nature
 `` the fellow sufferer who understands '' , and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events
 people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers -- so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in god ?
 as the being who is most affected by the world , god is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world
 `` process naturalism '' , i.e. a process theology without god .

 alexander bard and jan söderqvist
 process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests
 `` an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone . ''
 religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world
 a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society
 it is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people .
 pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior
 ontology that `` understands becoming as a relational process ; difference as being related , yet unique ; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference . ''

 response to the criticism of the kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation
 sexual orientation
 diverse attractions and behaviors that may reflect curiosity , experimentation , social pressure
 the amount and mix of homosexual and heterosexual behavior in a person 's biography and that person 's choice to label himself
 ritch savin-williams
 suggests that greater priority should be given to sexual arousal and attraction
 that biological measures should be developed and used .
 researchers should forsake the general notion of sexual orientation altogether
 assess only those components that are relevant for the research question being investigated
 that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns
 in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli .

 process in which information is encoded , stored , and retrieved .
 the type of information , and other attempts to remember stored information may be more demanding for various reasons .

 retrieval of information that has been stored
 an acoustic code for storing information , and to a lesser extent a visual code .
 subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar
 encoding of written text ;
 working memory .
 recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal

 stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process .
 can hamper memorization and retrieval
 when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information
 where prior learning disrupts recall of new information
 positive transfer .
 up until the middle of the 1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode , retain , and retrieve information .
 furthermore , research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time
 9-month-olds

 it is not sufficient to describe memory , and its counterpart , learning , as solely dependent on specific brain regions
 neuronal synapses ,
 believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning

 prenatally , the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life .
 when subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they have often difficulties

 there have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory ,

 activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day

 bill & melinda gates foundation -lrb- or the gates foundation , abbreviated as bmgf -rrb- is the largest private foundation in the world
 the foundation , based in seattle , washington
 in july 2013 , buffet announced another donation of his company 's class b , this time in the amount worth $ 2 billion
 as of january 1 , 2015 their open access policy is effective for all new agreements .
 trustees divided the organization into two entities : the bill & melinda gates foundation -lrb- foundation -rrb- and the bill & melinda gates foundation trust
 the foundation section , based in seattle , us , `` focuses on improving health and alleviating extreme poverty
 the trust section manages `` the investment assets and transfer proceeds to the foundation as necessary to achieve the foundation 's charitable goals
 it holds the assets of bill and melinda gates , who are the sole trustees , and receives contributions from buffett
 the foundation trust invests undistributed assets
 exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment
 its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries
 these include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world
 a human rights organization based in washington , d.c. , us to work in the area of sex trafficking .
 the grant would allow the ijm to `` create a replicable model for combating sex trafficking and slavery
 conducting undercover investigations , training law enforcement , rescuing victims , ensuring appropriate aftercare , and seeking perpetrator accountability '' .
 the ijm used the grant money to found `` project lantern
 `` project lantern '' and established an office in the philippines city of cebu .
 the ijm was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions .
 the water , sanitation and hygiene -lrb- wsh -rrb- program of the gates foundation was launched in mid-2005
 and became a full-fledged program under the global development division in early 2010
 since 2005 undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research , experimentation , reflection , advocacy , and field implementation
 in 2009 , the foundation decided to refocus its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor , using non-piped sanitation services
 this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments
 their grant-making focus has been since 2011 on sanitation science and technology -lrb- `` transformative technologies '' -rrb-
 delivery models at scale , urban sanitation markets , building demand for sanitation , measurement and evaluation as well as policy , advocacy and communications
 funding now focuses primarily on sanitation , particularly in sub-saharan africa and south asia , because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions
 in mid 2011 , the foundation announced in its new `` water , sanitation , hygiene strategy overview ''
 improved sanitation in the developing world is a global need
 improved sanitation in the developing world is a global need , but a neglected priority as shown by the data collected
 about one billion people have no sanitation facility whatsoever and continue to defecate in gutters , behind bushes or in open water bodies
 india is the country with the highest number of people practicing open defecation : around 600 million people
 `` reinvent the toilet fair '' in delhi , india in march 2014 .
 in 2011 , the foundation launched a program called `` reinvent the toilet challenge
 to promote the development of innovations in toilet design to benefit the 2.5 billion people that do not have access to safe and effective sanitation
 it was complemented by a program called `` grand challenges explorations '' -lrb- 2011 to 2013 with some follow-up grants reaching until 2015 -rrb-
 both funding schemes explicitly excluded project ideas that relied on centralized sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts
 the grants were in the order of 400,000 usd for their first phase , followed by typically 1-3 million usd for their second phase
 many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge .
 the reinvent the toilet challenge is a long-term research and development effort to develop a hygienic , stand-alone toilet
 this challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying
 the aim of the `` omni processor '' is to convert excreta -lrb- for example fecal sludge -rrb- into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients
 the foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of aids , tuberculosis and malaria
 protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases
 `` the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation
 discourage patients from discussing -- ailments that the vaccinations can not prevent '' .
 has decided not to fund abortion ''
 up to 2013 , the bill & melinda gates foundation provided $ 71 million to planned parenthood
 u.s. libraries initiative with a goal of `` ensuring that if you can get to a public library , you can reach the internet
 only 35 % of the world 's population has access to the internet
 the foundation has given grants , installed computers and software , and provided training and technical support in partnership with public libraries nationwide
 this foundation helps move public libraries into the digital age .
 it spent $ 373 million on education in 2009 .
 the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative .
 one of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster
 as part of its education-related initiatives , the foundation has funded journalists , think tanks , lobbying organizations and governments
 millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education
 critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage
 the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly
 teach plus , which was founded by new teachers and advocates against seniority-based layoffs
 several gates-backed policies such as small schools , charter schools , and increasing class sizes
 but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm
 peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance
 spend all of -lsb- the trust 's -rsb- resources within 20 years after bill 's and melinda 's deaths
 the proceeds from the berkshire hathaway shares he still owns at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years

 kept by humans for the eggs they produce , their meat , their feathers , or sometimes as pets .
 but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game .
 chickens , quails and turkeys
 from the latin word pullus , which means small animal .
 domestic ducks and domestic geese .
 domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago
 cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs
 selective breeding for fast growth , egg-laying ability , conformation , plumage and docility took place
 modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors .
 poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally
 guinea fowl and squabs -lrb- young pigeons -rrb-
 r. d. crawford
 frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild .
 many languages do not distinguish between `` poultry '' and `` fowl
 cocks
 cocks , are usually larger , more boldly coloured , and have more exaggerated plumage than females -lrb- hens -rrb- .
 in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds , invertebrates , and other small animals .
 they seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger , preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached .
 today 's domestic chicken -lrb- gallus gallus domesticus -rrb- is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of asia
 by the mid-20th century , the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry
 can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling
 with the exception of the white leghorn , most commercial birds are of hybrid origin .
 a bantam
 a bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken , either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed , or a `` true bantam '' with no larger counterpart
 bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs
 kept by small-holders and hobbyists for egg production , use as broody hens , ornamental purposes , and showing .
 cockfighting is said to be the world 's oldest spectator sport and may have originated in persia 6,000 years ago .
 cockfighting
 fight each other , and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed .
 breeds such as the aseel were developed in the indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour
 large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter .
 medium-sized aquatic birds with broad bills , eyes on the side of the head , fairly long necks , short legs set far back on the body , and webbed feet .
 drakes
 larger than females -lrb- simply known as ducks -rrb- and are differently coloured in some breeds
 aquatic insects , molluscs , worms , small amphibians , waterweeds , and grasses .
 most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly
 clay models of ducks found in china dating back to 4000 bc may indicate the domestication of ducks took place there during the yangshao culture
 domestication of the duck took place in the far east at least 1500 years earlier than in the west
 ducks did not appear in agricultural texts in western europe until about 810 ad
 mentioned alongside geese , chickens , and peafowl as being used for rental payments made by tenants to landowners .
 mallard -lrb- anas platyrhynchos -rrb- is the ancestor of all breeds of domestic duck -lrb- with the exception of the muscovy duck
 various breeds have been developed , selected for egg-laying ability , fast growth , and a well-covered carcase .
 pekin duck
 can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3.5 kg -lrb- 7.7 lb -rrb- in 44 days
 ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in
 the greylag goose -lrb- anser anser -rrb- was domesticated by the egyptians at least 3000 years ago
 chinese goose
 siberia
 despite their early domestication , geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks .
 domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks , an upright posture , and large bodies with broad rear ends
 the greylag-derived birds
 chinese geese
 use in pillows and padded garments
 they deposit fat subcutaneously , although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids
 descended from one of six subspecies of wild turkey
 pre-aztec tribes in south-central mexico first domesticated the bird around 800 bc
 feathers for robes , blankets , and ceremonial purposes
 pueblo indians inhabiting the colorado plateau in the united states did likewise around 200 bc .
 commercial turkeys are usually reared indoors under controlled conditions
 the lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day , or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly
 females achieve slaughter weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19
 mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts
 60 million birds in the united states
 they were originally kept as songbirds , and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests .
 it is found in bushy places , in rough grassland , among agricultural crops , and in other places with dense cover .
 seeds , insects , and other small invertebrates .
 modern domesticated flocks are mostly of japanese quail -lrb- coturnix japonica -rrb-
 japanese breeders began to selectively breed for increased egg production .
 by 1940 , the quail egg industry was flourishing ,
 the events of world war ii led to the complete loss of quail lines bred for their song type , as well as almost all of those bred for egg production
 modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year
 japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics , embryology , nutrition , physiology , pathology , and toxicity studies
 africa
 ancient greeks and romans .
 they will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry lyme disease .
 roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators .
 a squab
 rock pigeon -lrb- columba livia -rrb-
 when they hatch , the squabs are fed by both parents on `` pigeon 's milk '' , a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop
 a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a breeding season lasting several months
 worldwide , more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry
 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs .
 high feed costs could limit further development of poultry production
 birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks , foraging during the day and housed at night .
 the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry
 the birds have access to natural conditions and can exhibit their normal behaviours
 birds have access to a fenced yard and poultry house at a higher stocking rate
 battery cages , often set in multiple tiers
 the eggs are laid on the floor of the cage and roll into troughs outside for ease of collection
 carcass size -lrb- 2 kg -lrb- 4.4 lb -rrb- -rrb-
 six weeks or less
 mortality rates at 1 %
 their legs can not always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles .
 18 weeks to reach similar weights
 cannibalism , feather pecking and vent pecking can be common
 some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure
 the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds .
 in southeast asia , a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza .
 barn systems have been found to have the worst bird welfare .
 in many countries , national and regional poultry shows are held where enthusiasts exhibit their birds
 birds which are judged on certain phenotypical breed traits as specified by their respective breed standards
 breed standards were drawn up for egg-laying , meat-type , and purely ornamental birds , aiming for uniformity
 the annual `` national championship show '' in the united kingdom organised by the poultry club of great britain .
 the idea of poultry exhibition may have originated after cockfighting was made illegal , as a way of maintaining a competitive element in poultry husbandry
 poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat in the world , accounting for about 30 % of total meat production worldwide
 sixteen billion birds are raised annually
 more than half of these in industrialised , factory-like production units
 there are two distinct models of production ;
 the european union supply chain model seeks to supply products which can be traced back to the farm of origin
 china producing two thirds of the total , some 1.7 billion birds
 vietnam , thailand , malaysia , myanmar , indonesia and south korea -lrb- 12 % in total -rrb-
 france -lrb- 3.5 % -rrb- is the largest producer in the west ,
 94 % share
 the meatiest parts of a bird are the flight muscles on its chest , called `` breast '' meat , and the walking muscles on the legs , called the `` thigh '' and `` drumstick ''
 fresh or frozen , as whole birds or as joints -lrb- cuts -rrb- , bone-in or deboned , seasoned in various ways , raw or ready cooked .
 the dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin , which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells
 white muscle , in contrast , is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as , for chickens , flying
 the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can diffract light and produce iridescent colours
 birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight , such as ducks and geese , have red muscle -lrb- and therefore dark meat -rrb- throughout
 translational genomics research

 thorough cooking of the product would kill these bacteria ,
 a risk of cross-contamination from improper handling of the raw product is still present
 the virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic .
 many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs .
 egg allergies are unable to be immunised
 process that takes about six months
 viruses need living cells in which to replicate
 protein of high quality
 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein
 two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat

 pro wrestling
 an athletic form of entertainment based on a portrayal of a combat sport
 the combative actions and reactions are executed in special manners designed to both protect from , yet simulate , pain
 willing suspension of disbelief for the audience
 match outcomes is choreographed
 will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle .
 it has greatly declined in europe
 the advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet
 live event ticket sales , network television broadcasts , pay-per-view broadcasts , personal appearances by performers , branded merchandise and home video
 madison square garden , as well as football stadiums
 to air web shows , internet pay-per-views -lrb- ippvs -rrb- or on-demand content
 wrestlemania , summerslam , royal rumble , and formerly bash at the beach , halloween havoc and starrcade
 particularly since the 1950s , pro wrestling events have frequently been responsible for sellout crowds at large arenas
 2008 film the wrestler
 several oscar nominations
 beyond the mat directed by barry w. blaustein , and wrestling with shadows
 in both academia and the media
 the united states-based wwe
 wcw and extreme championship wrestling -lrb- ecw -rrb-
 prominent figures in the wrestling business -lrb- including wwe owner vince mcmahon -rrb-
 this public reveal has garnered mixed reactions from the wrestling community
 many u.s. states still regulate professional wrestling as they do other professional competitive sports
 the audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as spectators
 this leads to a high level of audience participation
 their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds .
 often , individual matches will be part of a longer storyline conflict between `` babyfaces '' -lrb- often shortened to just `` faces '' -rrb- and `` heels '' .
 `` heels '' -lrb- the `` bad guys '' -rrb-
 the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls , submissions , or countouts being the winner .
 historically , matches were wrestled to 3 falls -lrb- `` best 2 out of 3 '' -rrb- or 5 falls -lrb- `` best 3 out of 5 '' -rrb- .
 the standard for modern matches is one fall .
 if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit , the match is declared a draw .
 title matches can go for up to one hour
 is forced out of the match
 no holds barred rules
 to simply go one fall , with the one scoring the fall , regardless of who they scored it against , being the winner .
 the most common of these is the ladder match
 in the basic ladder match , the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring .
 the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team .
 20-30 wrestlers
 their actions are also frequently scripted for dramatic effect
 the most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall or disqualification .
 most referees are unnamed and essentially anonymous , though the wwe has let their officials reveal their names .
 distracting or disabling the referee in order to perform some ostensibly illegal maneuver on their opponent .
 special guest referees may be used from time to time ;
 they also have the power to eject from ringside any of the heel wrestler 's entourage/stable , who may otherwise interfere with the match .
 an elevated square canvas mat with posts on each corner .
 three horizontal ropes or cables surround the ring ,
 for safety , the ropes are padded at the turnbuckles and cushioned mats surround the floor outside the ring .
 two wrestlers must make physical contact -lrb- typically palm-to-palm -rrb- in order to transfer this legal status .
 `` tagging out '' and `` tagging in '' .
 has a 5-second count to leave the ring
 the one tagging in can enter the ring at any time , resulting in heels legally double-teaming a face .
 tags can be made between any two wrestlers .
 this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action
 any time that a wrestler 's shoulders are down -lrb- both shoulders touching the mat -rrb- , back-first and any part of the opponent 's body is lying over the wrestler .
 a cocky wrestler may place their foot gently on the opponent 's body , prompting a three-count from the referee .
 wrestler who is half-conscious may simply drape an arm over an opponent
 one wrestler is covering another prone , back-first wrestler can be considered a pin attempt
 a stomp to the back and an elbow to the back of the head
 broken
 using the ropes for leverage and hooking the opponent 's clothing ,
 such pins as these are rarely seen by the referee
 cheating
 it is rare for such an attempt to result in a disqualification
 results in nullification of the pin attempt ,
 verbally informing the referee

 tapping out
 submission
 mixed martial arts
 an arm or leg
 if any part of the body is touching , or underneath , the ropes ,

 the count of five
 they are disqualified
 a referee will wave their hand in front of the wrestler 's face
 if nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count , the match is ruled a draw .
 usually ten seconds , twenty in japan
 referee stoppage
 when they or official ring physician decides that a wrestler can not safely continue the match
 an injury
 due to excessive blood loss and impaired vision
 great american bash
 `` count-out '' or `` count out ''
 when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten
 sliding in the ring , and immediately sliding back out

 if the state 's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other floridians , democratic candidate al gore would have won florida
 that at least two districts had to be redrawn because of gerrymandering
 lawmakers had followed an illegal and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives , and ruled that at least eight districts had to be redrawn
 a 5-2 majority of the court accepted a new map of congressional districts
 there are likely to be additional challenges to the map and districts .

 claudius decided the empire should not expand north .
 to consolidate the border the limes germanicus defense line was constructed along the main branch of the river rhine
 these fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 roman soldiers
 near the fort settlements would grow housing artisans , traders and soldiers ' wives and children
 germanic tribes regularly invaded the roman territories .
 around 275 the romans could no longer maintain the northern border and utrecht was abandoned
 little is known about the next period 270 -- 650 .
 a church was built within the walls of the roman fortress
 in ongoing border conflicts with the frisians this first church was destroyed .
 english and irish missionaries set out to convert the frisians
 the pope appointed their leader , willibrordus , bishop of the frisians
 frankish leader charles martel bestowed the fortress in utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops
 after the fall of dorestad around 850 , utrecht became one of the most important cities in the netherlands
 utrecht as a centre of christianity is illustrated by the election of the utrecht-born adriaan florenszoon boeyens as pope in 1522
 the bishops of utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops
 not only included the modern province of utrecht -lrb- nedersticht , ` lower sticht ' -rrb- , but also extended to the northeast
 the feudal conflict of the middle ages heavily affected utrecht
 the counts of holland and the dukes of guelders
 the veluwe region was seized by guelders
 the most dominant of these was the cathedral of saint martin , inside the old roman fortress
 the construction of the present gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire
 the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished
 besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in utrecht
 the city housed st. paul 's abbey , the 15th-century beguinage of st. nicholas , and a 14th-century chapter house of the teutonic knights .
 allowed utrecht to become an important trade centre in the northern netherlands .
 henry v in 1122
 the bishop , who controlled many lands outside of the city , and the citizens of utrecht was not always easy
 the bishop , for example dammed the kromme rijn at wijk bij duurstede to protect his estates from flooding
 in 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both neder - and oversticht -- which included the city of utrecht -- to charles v , holy roman emperor
 charles v combined the seventeen provinces -lrb- the current benelux and the northern parts of france -rrb- as a personal union
 the prince-bishopric utrecht , as the secular rule was now the lordship of utrecht , with the religious power remaining with the bishop
 in 1559 the bishopric of utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious center of the northern ecclesiastical province in the seventeen provinces
 charles v was struggling to exert his power over the citizens of the city , who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops
 the heavily fortified castle vredenburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city
 the castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the dutch revolt
 the northern seven provinces signed the union of utrecht , in which they decided to join forces against spanish rule
 the union of utrecht is seen as the beginning of the dutch republic
 towards its dominant province holland
 utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40 % catholic in the mid-17th century , and even more among the elite groups
 temporarily fell to the french invasion in 1672 -lrb- the disaster year -rrb- ; where the french invasion was only stopped west of utrecht
 the centre of utrecht was struck by a tornado
 the halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral
 in 1713 , utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the treaty of utrecht settled the war of the spanish succession
 utrecht became the centre of the non-roman old catholic churches in the world
 the role of utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete
 a railway connecting utrecht to amsterdam was opened
 the dutch government allowed the bishopric of utrecht to be reinstated by rome , and utrecht became the centre of dutch catholicism
 new middle class residential areas , such as tuindorp and oog in al , were built
 were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s , in a brutalist style
 the shopping mall hoog catharijne
 in the early 21st century the whole area is being redeveloped
 about 38 % percent of its population either earns a minimum income or is dependent on social welfare
 about 69 % of the population is of dutch ancestry
 kanaleneiland , overvecht and hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments , and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate
 which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult , and somewhat arbitrary .
 smaller utrecht agglomeration of continuously built up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes nieuwegein , ijsselstein and maarssen
 the larger region , including slightly more remote towns such as woerden and amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants
 utrecht 's cityscape is dominated by the dom tower , the tallest belfry in the netherlands and originally part of the cathedral of saint martin
 an ongoing debate is over whether any building in or near the centre of town should surpass the dom tower in height -lrb- 112 m -rrb-
 the nieuw galgenwaard stadium -lrb- 2007 -rrb-
 the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city
 the inner city has largely retained its medieval structure , and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact
 surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th - and early 20th-century neighbourhoods , with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out
 the eastern part of utrecht remains fairly open
 utrecht centraal is the main railway station of utrecht
 utrecht centraal is a station on the night service , providing 7 days a week an all night service
 international intercityexpress -lrb- ice -rrb- services to germany -lrb- and further -rrb- through arnhem call at utrecht centraal
 local trains to all areas surrounding utrecht also depart from utrecht centraal ; and service several smaller stations
 the main local and regional bus station of utrecht is located adjacent to utrecht centraal railway station , at the east and west entrances
 large scale renovation and construction works at the railway station , the station 's bus stops are changing frequently
 local buses in utrecht are operated by qbuzz -- its services include a high-frequency service to the uithof university district
 the local bus fleet is one of europe 's cleanest , using only buses compliant with the euro-vi standard as well as electric buses for inner city transport
 there are also barrow bikes , for carrying shopping or small children
 in 2014 to build the world 's largest bicycle parking station , near the central railway station
 a12 and a2 motorways connect amsterdam , arnhem , the hague and maastricht , as well as belgium and germany
 increasing traffic and the ancient city plan , traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around utrecht , causing elevated levels of air pollutants
 the economy of utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city
 it is the centre of the dutch railroad network and the location of the head office of nederlandse spoorwegen
 rabobank , a large bank , has its headquarters in utrecht .
 hoog catharijne
 the corridors are treated as public places like streets , and the route between the station and the city centre is open all night
 parts of the city 's network of canals , which were filled to create the shopping center and central station area , will be recreated
 the jaarbeurs , one of the largest convention centres in the netherlands , is located at the west side of the central railway station
 the most prominent of these is utrecht university -lrb- est. 1636 -rrb- , the largest university of the netherlands with 30,449 students
 according to shanghai jiaotong university 's university ranking in 2014 it is the 57th best university in the world
 utrecht also houses the much smaller university of humanistic studies , which houses about 400 students .
 utrecht city has an active cultural life , and in the netherlands is second only to amsterdam
 utrecht is host to the international early music festival -lrb- festival oude muziek , for music before 1800 -rrb- and the netherlands film festival
 the city has an important classical music hall vredenburg
 young musicians are educated in the conservatory , a department of the utrecht school of the arts
 training of artists is done at the utrecht school of the arts
 although street art is illegal in utrecht
 1924 rietveld schröder house , which is listed on unesco 's world heritage sites
 to promote culture utrecht city organizes cultural sundays
 thematic sunday several organisations create a program , which is open to everyone without , or with a very much reduced , admission fee
 an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants -lrb- utrechts centrum voor de kunsten
 the city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives .
 utrecht is home to the premier league -lrb- professional -rrb- football club fc utrecht
 utrecht 's waterways are used by several rowing clubs
 kampong , the largest -lrb- amateur -rrb- sportsclub in the netherlands -lrb- 4,500 members -rrb-

 paul halmos states that `` von neumann 's speed was awe-inspiring . ''
 neumann actually enjoyed thinking , maybe even to the exclusion of everything else .
 `` fastest mind i ever met '' ,
 johnny was the only student i was ever afraid of .
 one of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall .
 he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes .
 von neumann 's way of thinking might not be visual , but more of an aural one .
 i have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von neumann 's does not indicate a species superior to that of man
 he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics

 sharp divergence in character between breeds ,
 extinction of some species
 descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions
 sexual selection , driven by competition between males for mates
 the descent of man , and selection in relation to sex
 a tree diagram and calculations
 environmental factors
 `` the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown . ''
 breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection
 1868
 hypothesis of pangenesis .
 darwin 's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable
 in the 1930s and 1940s
 neo darwinian evolution
 often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found
 why , if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations , do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms ?
 the competition between different forms , combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms , often leading to extinction of such forms .
 flying squirrels , and flying lemurs
 simple eyes found in invertebrates , starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment
 any complex organ existed , which could not possibly have been formed by numerous , successive , slight modifications , my theory would absolutely break down .
 he thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps .
 he suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells , under pressure from natural selection to economise wax
 some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others
 in order to preserve separately created species
 the viability and fertility of the hybrids , varied greatly , especially among plants
 support the view , that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties
 to respond to criticisms of earlier editions
 that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection
 fertilisation of orchids
 darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature .
 that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms
 300 million years
 the cambrian explosion
 slowly , but not at the same rate
 variability and change in the environment
 richard owen
 recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras
 barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions .
 his explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification .
 morphology
 animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos
 that his theory might produce revolutionary changes
 to show that species had not been separately created , and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change
 the concept of transmutation of species
 his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism .
 the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation .
 darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines
 darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics
 it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation
 its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction .
 no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological , social and religious implications
 darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science
 social reform
 darwin 's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms
 darwinism
 the transmutational ideas of lamarck and the vague `` law of development '' of vestiges had not found scientific favour
 natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible .
 the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology , including joseph dalton hooker in 1860 , and asa gray in 1862
 henry walter bates
 thomas henry huxley
 that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies
 richard owen ,
 bitterly attacked huxley , hooker and darwin , but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous `` ordained becoming ''
 huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans , contesting owen 's view that humans were a separate sub-class
 legendary 1860 oxford evolution debate
 darwin published his own explanation in the descent of man -lrb- 1871 -rrb-
 natural selection
 bronn 's alterations in his german translation added to the misgivings of conservatives
 political radicals
 aiming to synthesise darwin 's ideas with those of lamarck and goethe while still reflecting the spirit of naturphilosophie
 darwin 's ideas had little impact in france , where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of lamarckism
 the intelligentsia in russia
 the malthusian aspects
 leo tolstoy
 insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection

 neo-darwinism
 mendelian inheritance
 walter bagehot 's physics and politics -lrb- 1872 -rrb-
 to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of caucasians over non white races and justify european imperialism
 to justify military aggression and unethical business practices
 he opposed polygenism , the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry .
 strongly opposed to the ideas in the book
 interpreted natural selection as an instrument of god 's design
 some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that darwin later regretted
 darwin 's view at the time was of god creating life through the laws of nature
 baden powell praised `` mr darwin 's masterly volume -lsb- supporting -rsb- the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature ''
 defending the book in terms of theistic evolution , natural selection is not inconsistent with natural theology .
 theistic evolution became a popular compromise
 supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation
 by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans
 charles hodge
 the american creation -- evolution controversy
 the vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical , which held that evolution was not inconsistent with catholic teaching .
 darwin 's theory of evolution
 the theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment .

 since errors tend to accumulate , older manuscripts should have fewer errors .
 geographically diverse
 more than one prior copy -lrb- exemplar -rrb- was consulted in producing the current one
 applying this principle leads to taking the more difficult -lrb- unharmonized -rrb- reading as being more likely to be the original .

 more difficult reading
 they proposed nine critical rules
 the reading is less likely to be original that shows a disposition to smooth away difficulties .
 `` the reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others . ''
 readings are approved or rejected by reason of the quality , and not the number , of their supporting witnesses

 eclecticism
 critics tended overwhelmingly to produce trees divided into just two branches .
 the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses .
 editors tended to favor trees with two branches
 this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment
 the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed .
 emendatio
 the critic employs conjecture at every step of the process
 , it may be no more than fortuitous that more witnesses have survived that present a particular reading

 we must accept all the alterations of that edition , saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints

 it was clear that the result in ohio , along with two other states who had still not declared -lrb- new mexico and iowa -rrb- , would decide the winner
 provisional ballots that had yet to be counted , initially reported to number as high as 200,000
 the result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the house of representatives with each state casting one vote , regardless of population
 the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in ohio
 al gore
 a motion was made contesting ohio 's electoral votes
 during the debate , no senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote
 senator boxer
 senator boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome , but to `` shed the light of truth on these irregularities . ''
 not voting were 52 republicans and 80 democrats
 `` the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the -lsb- ohio -rsb- outcome reflected the will of the voters . ''

 the republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections

 people in authority who think they know how to run things better
 mistakes the nature of the conservative outlook
 to function smoothly
 the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day
 can result in dehydration due to fluid loss
 loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour
 decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness
 an infection of the intestines
 a virus , bacteria , or parasite
 short duration watery diarrhea , short duration bloody diarrhea , and if it lasts for more than two weeks , persistent diarrhea
 dysentery
 improved sanitation , clean drinking water , and hand washing with soap
 breastfeeding for at least six months
 oral rehydration solution -lrb- ors -rrb- , which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar
 cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever , those with severe diarrhea following travelling , and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites
 1.7 to 5 billion cases
 average three times a year
 malnutrition
 stunted growth and poor intellectual development
 an increase in the active secretion , or there is an inhibition of absorption
 cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions , especially chloride ions
 if a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt , these can draw water from the body into the bowel
 alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels
 too much magnesium or vitamin c or undigested lactose
 when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border
 a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids
 bacterial infections , viral infections , parasitic infections , or autoimmune problems
 tuberculosis , colon cancer , and enteritis .
 a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental development
 reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults
 diarrhea
 significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence
 irritable bowel syndrome
 abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool -lrb- diarrhea or constipation -rrb- for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months
 a combination of dietary changes , soluble fiber supplements , and/or medications
 poverty
 from the conditions under which impoverished people live
 the lack of adequate , available , and affordable medical care .
 for health and functioning , including the prevention of infectious diarrhea
 greater number of instances of diarrhea , severe diarrhea , and diarrhea associated with fever
 cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes
 127 million
 diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism
 there might be a delay in recovery .
 caused people to stay feverish twice as long as those not so treated .
 basic sanitation techniques
 approximately 42 -- 48 %
 access to soap and water is limited
 implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours
 water contamination
 clean water supply and improved sanitation
 22 -- 27 % reduction in disease incidence
 it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination
 promoting better eating practices
 zinc
 zinc supplementation
 replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed
 this is usually by mouth -- oral rehydration therapy -- or , in severe cases , intravenously
 brat diet
 children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain
 oral rehydration solution -lrb- ors -rrb-
 salted rice water , salted yogurt drinks , vegetable and chicken soups with salt
 pedialyte
 one liter water with one teaspoon salt -lrb- 3 grams -rrb- and two tablespoons sugar -lrb- 18 grams -rrb- added
 drinks especially high in simple sugars , such as soft drinks and fruit juices
 a too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body , just as if the person were to drink sea water
 a nasogastric tube
 a child with diarrhea continue to be fed
 continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function
 children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly
 they are usually not used except in specific situations
 may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome in people infected with escherichia coli o157 : h7
 some bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance

 two coalitions , led by great britain on one side and france
 it involved every great power of the time except the ottoman empire
 the seven years ' war was fought between 1755 and 1764
 britain rose as the world 's predominant power
 considered a prelude to the two world wars
 prussia preemptively struck
 saxony
 prussia 's alliance with britain
 austria formed an alliance with france
 anglo-prussian alliance was joined by smaller german states
 the dutch republic , long-time british ally , kept its neutrality intact
 naples , sicily , and savoy , although sided with franco-spanish party , declined to join the coalition under the fear of british power
 the taxation needed for war caused the russian people considerable hardship
 being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by empress elizabeth in 1759
 like sweden , russia concluded a separate peace with prussia .
 france was deprived of many of its colonies
 had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle
 the term `` second hundred years ' war '' has been used in order to describe the almost continuous level of world-wide conflict during the entire 18th century ,
 reminiscent of the more famous and compact struggle of the 14th century
 sweden , fearing prussia 's expansionist tendencies , went to war in 1757 to protect its baltic dominions ,
 spain , bound by the pacte de famille , intervened on behalf of france and together they launched a disastrous invasion of portugal
 spain , bound by the pacte de famille , intervened on behalf of france and together they launched a disastrous invasion of portugal in 1762

 naples , sicily , and savoy , although sided with franco-spanish party , declined to join the coalition under the fear of british power
 the native american tribes were excluded from the settlement
 ; a subsequent conflict , known as pontiac 's war , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status .
 good luck and successful strategy
 king frederick the great
 great britain and austria , had coalesced
 british military effort had not saved silesia for austria
 british subsidies to austria had produced nothing of much help to the british
 the collapse of that system and the aligning of france with austria and of great britain with prussia constituted what is known as the `` diplomatic revolution ''
 june 2 , 1746 , austria and russia concluded a defensive alliance that covered their own territory and poland against attack by prussia or the ottoman empire
 they also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of silesia and the countship of glatz -lrb- now kłodzko , poland -rrb- to austria
 the countship of glatz -lrb- now kłodzko , poland -rrb- to austria
 their real desire , however , was to destroy frederick 's power altogether
 his commitments in germany were counterbalanced by the demands of the british colonies overseas
 it had no desire to divert forces to central europe for prussia 's interest .
 france was very much interested in colonial expansion and was willing to exploit the vulnerability of hanover in war against great britain
 hanover had to be secured against franco-prussian attack
 goal of pursuing personal political objectives that were often at odds with france 's publicly stated policies

 a column of about 15,000 men
 a column of 18,000 men
 a corps of 30,000 troops .
 saxon and austrian armies were unprepared , and their forces were scattered .

 that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move
 a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car
 the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank
 travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers
 passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart
 the system is subject to gaming
 the dispatching algorithm
 people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators
 this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person
 every user gets an rfid card to identify himself
 the system knows every user call and can cancel the first call if the passenger decides to travel to another destination to prevent empty calls
 either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons
 when they reach a pre-determined passenger load , or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time
 to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity

 a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled ` inspection ' , ` car top ' , ` access enable ' or ` hwenab
 the elevator will come to a stop if moving
 the elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding ` access ' key switches
 a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building
 the elevator will wait an amount of time , then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor
 the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor
 the only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset
 the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to
 phase-two mode can only be activated by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralized control panel
 manually pushes and holds the door close button
 enables the car to move
 this mode was created for firefighters so that they may rescue people from a burning building
 on the cop
 it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator
 medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car , select their floor and close the doors with the door close button
 the elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor
 will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car
 allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated
 one by one , each car in the group will return to the lobby floor , open its doors and shut down
 people in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly
 the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service
 the car -lrb- s -rrb- selected to run under emergency power can be manually overridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby
 when the system detects that it is running low on power , it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor , open the doors and shut down
 emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit
 the doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset , usually by cycling the elevator main power switch
 due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor

 never be an option
 original sin only
 mary was preserved from any stain -lrb- in latin , macula or labes
 sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
 makes no declaration about the church 's belief that the blessed virgin was sinless in the sense of freedom from actual or personal sin
 the church holds that mary was also sinless personally , `` free from all sin , original or personal
 doctrine of the immaculate conception -lrb- mary being conceived free from original sin -rrb- is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son jesus
 catholics believe that mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother
 since the 4th century
 1677 , the holy see condemned the belief that mary was virginally conceived ,
 saint joachim and saint anne
 dogma in ineffabilis deus , pope pius ix explicitly affirmed that mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime
 another misunderstanding is that , by her immaculate conception , mary did not need a saviour
 catholic church has taught that even had man never sinned in the garden of eden and was sinless , he would still require god 's grace to remain sinless .
 jesus christ , the savior of the human race .
 greek theologians of byzantium
 st. augustine -lrb- d. 430 -rrb- may be cited : `` as regards the mother of god , '' he says , `` i will not allow any question whatever of sin .
 mary 's immaculate conception appears only later among latin -lrb- and particularly frankish -rrb- theologians
 to call mary `` prepurified ''
 emperor justinian i ,
 the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the byzantine east
 under the name of the conception -lrb- active -rrb- of saint anne
 in the west it was known as the feast of the conception -lrb- passive -rrb- of mary , and was associated particularly with the normans
 critics included saints bernard of clairvaux , albertus magnus and thomas aquinas .
 out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of christ , a view held especially by franciscans .
 authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of rome in 1477
 pope sixtus iv , authorized those dioceses
 appoint spada master of the sacred palace in 1867
 pope pius ix
 pius ix was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the aquinas ' teaching .
 st bernard of clairvaux
 st bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the holy see .
 how can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence -lrb- libido -rrb- ?
 conception in the active sense of the mother 's cooperation
 instituting such a festival without the permission of the holy see
 popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of mary 's conception .
 stated that belief in the immaculate conception of mary is in accord with the catholic faith .
 papal bull defining the dogma , ineffabilis deus
 genesis 3:15
 contemporary eastern orthodox christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception
 dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an `` over-elaboration ''
 because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin .
 took its historical point of departure from sophronios , damascene , and their imitators .
 mariology
 some lutherans , such as the members of the anglo-lutheran catholic church , support the doctrine .
 claim that the immaculate conception of mary is a teaching of islam .
 muslim tradition or hadith , which states that the only children born without the `` touch of satan , '' were mary and jesus .
 hannah 's prayer in the quran for her child to remain protected from satan
 the latin church has not disdained to borrow from the koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother
